## Galley Grub Front End

This is the front end repository for my backend Rails API

Here lives the HTML CSS and JS for front end interaction and will eventually use fetch requests to fetch information from the backend: [galley-grub-backend](https://github.com/wizbeck21/galley-grub-backend) which is the Rails API built with seed data to replicate the menu of the Krusty Krab from SpongeBob Squarepants

Checkout the wiki of both this repo and the backend repo for my ideas that went into the project.
